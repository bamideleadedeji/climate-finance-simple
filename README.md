Climate risk analysis for Kenyan agriculture using R
Project Overview
This analysis examines climate vulnerability in Kenya's maize sector, quantifying financial risks and 
identifying strategic investment opportunities for climate adaptation. Using empirical data and economic 
modeling, the project provides evidence-based insights for climate-resilient agricultural finance.
Financial Analysis

Investment Requirements
Short-term: $15-20 million for technology scaling and capacity building
Medium-term: $50-70 million for financial product development and market systems
Leverage Potential: Each public dollar can mobilize 3-5x private co-investment

For Policymakers
Economic Imperative: Climate impacts could reduce agricultural GDP by 5-7% by 2030
Strategic Priority: Align agricultural policies with climate resilience objectives
Coordination Need: Multi-stakeholder platforms for public-private collaboration

The analysis provides a clear roadmap for transforming climate vulnerability into investment opportunity, 
creating a more resilient and productive agricultural system for Kenya's future
